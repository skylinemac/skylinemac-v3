# What is SMAC?
> What is the point of learning math?

Middle school math curriculum--and even competition math (think AMC, MATHCOUNTS...)--is filled with memorizing formula and solving problems that often seem entirely abstract. As such, learning math is frequently seen as a pointless task for many kids. 

However, in our own high school careers, being exposed to the beauty of higher math and seeing the subject being applied everywhere in our lives has helped us realized: it isn't math itself that is boring, it is the way it has been introduced. Hence, with the **Skyline Mathematical Applications Contest (SMAC)**, we've taken a different approach:

The SMAC's questions focus on introducing math's real world applications, using previously abstract concepts and applying them to everything from engineering/physics to buying the best-valued donut. Much like the problem sets found in college math, competitors will **discover and derive** new concepts and learn new things, rather than being simply told that these concepts exist. Of course, with the engaging competition format and a healthy dose of humor sprinkled throughout our questions, our ultimate hope is that students have fun and learn that there _is a point to learning math_.

# Competition Format
The SMAC will have **4 rounds**. A detailed description of each round is found below, along with how the competition will be scored and who we will be awarding. Units are **not required** for any of the answers throughout this contest, and students may use scratch paper for all parts of the contest only if it is provided by SMAC organizers. No calculators will be allowed in any part of the test.
